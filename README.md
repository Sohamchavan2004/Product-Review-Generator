## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

### **1. Input**
Send a product URL to the n8n webhook via a POST request:
```json
{
  "productUrl": "<PRODUCT_URL>"
}
```

### **2. Workflow Steps**

#### **Product Info Extraction**
- Parses the product page to extract key details (name, variant, specifications).

#### **Review Aggregation**
- Searches e-commerce sites (Flipkart, Amazon, Walmart, etc.) and forums (Quora, StackExchange, Reddit) for user reviews.
- Uses [Firecrawl](https://firecrawl.dev/) as the main scraper for robust data extraction.

#### **Review Cleaning**
- Removes HTML tags, duplicates, and irrelevant text for cleaner analysis.

#### **Feature & Sentiment Analysis**
- Analyzes reviews for key product features (e.g., display, camera, battery).
- Categorizes sentiments: positive, negative, or neutral.
- Powered by AI (Google Gemini / PaLM API) for high-quality insights.

#### **HTML Blog Generation**
- Produces a ready-to-publish HTML post with:
  - **Header:** Product title and summary
  - **Pros & Cons:** Highlights top positives and negatives
  - **Feature Analysis:** Detailed insights per feature with sentiment
  - **User Opinions:** Key quotes from real users
  - **Verdict:** Overall rating and purchase recommendations

### **3. Output**
Returns a JSON object containing the full HTML blog post:
```json
{
  "parts": [
    {
      "text": "<!DOCTYPE html> ... </html>"
    }
  ]
}
```
HTML includes all structured sections, ready for publishing.
